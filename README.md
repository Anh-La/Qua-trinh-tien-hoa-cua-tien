# Evolution of Money

## Table of Contents

- Raw Money
- Precious Metal Money
- Gold & Gold-backed Money
- Fiat Money
- Bitcoin

## Introduction

> "The idea that the government creates money is a common misconception. In reality, money is a naturally occurring phenomenon. It simply represents the most widely traded commodity in all markets."  
— Robert Breedlove

---

## Raw Money

"Money existed long before the advent of trade economies. It served a purpose even before trade and was more significant. Money greatly improved the exchange of small goods by reducing the need for credit."  
— Nick Szabo (Source: The Origins of Money)

Examples of raw money:
- Shells
- Tools
- Arrows
- Commodities like grains

    slides[i].style.display = "none";  
  }
  slideIndex++;
  if (slideIndex > slides.length) {slideIndex = 1}    
  slides[slideIndex-1].style.display = "block";

}

## Precious Metal Money

### Gold

- Example: Gold Daric (c. 490 BC)

### Silver

- Example: Silver Siglos Type I (c. 520-505 BC)

> "As technology advanced, particularly in metallurgy, humans developed better forms of money."  
— Saifedean Ammous (The Bitcoin Standard)

The rarity of metals due to the relative difficulty in production, combined with their durability compared to shells, grains, and beads, contributed significantly to their value.

---

## Gold-backed Paper Money

As trade expanded, transporting large quantities of gold became risky. Receipts (redeemable for gold) offered a convenient solution for reputable banks.

> "When a person stores goods in a warehouse, they receive a receipt and pay the warehouse owner a fee for the storage service. The person retains ownership of the goods, while the warehouse owner merely holds them. When the receipt is presented, the goods must be returned to the owner."  
— Murray Rothbard (Man, Economy, and State)

---

## Fiat Money

After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, fiat money, which cannot be directly exchanged for a fixed amount of any asset, became prevalent. 

> "U.S. Federal Reserve notes are not redeemable in gold, silver, or any other commodity, and are not backed by anything."  
— U.S. Department of the Treasury

Fiat money is now the standard, where its utility is enforced by law, and it's the only currency recognized for tax payments.

---

## The Digital Age

The rise of digital money began with the development of digital networks and personal devices, which made payment protocols easier to standardize.

### Credit Cards

The invention of credit cards led to widespread consumer borrowing, shifting priorities towards short-term consumption over long-term investment or saving.

---

## Bitcoin

Bitcoin represents a breakthrough in digital currency, allowing for a decentralized, end-to-end system without third-party involvement. Previous attempts to create digital currencies faced challenges that Bitcoin overcame.

> "I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party."  
— Satoshi Nakamoto

---

## Key Properties of Money

According to Robert Breedlove, money, as the most widely traded commodity in an economy, has five important characteristics:

1. **Scarcity**: Difficult to produce, which limits supply and reduces value depreciation.
2. **Divisibility**: Can be divided into smaller units.
3. **Portability**: Easy to transport from one place to another.
4. **Durability**: Not easily damaged and can be stored over time.
5. **Acceptability**: Widely accepted in transactions and easily verifiable.

---

## CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies)

CBDCs aim to compete in the digital age, offering a centralized, non-permissionless infrastructure. Their development also seeks to increase oversight and transaction censorship.

> "The key difference with CBDCs is that the central bank will have absolute control."  
— Agustin Carstens (General Manager, Bank for International Settlements)

---

## Conclusion

Bitcoin is designed for the digital age—open-source and upgradeable, benefiting directly from the creativity and innovation of all its users and developers.
